                    Say you're playing a game, and you notice that at any given time, there are hundreds of little things appearing and vanishing in an instant, with apparently no 
                    hang ups or loading. You think to yourself "man, this is buttery smooth, everything I make takes forever to load." Well one way they achieve this, especially on 
                    consoles, is to use a design pattern known as Object Pool.

                    This web page will give you a quick breakdown on Object Pool, and how you could use it to help save time and possibly keep your programs from crashing!
